# Desk Lamp - Pure CSS

A flickering desk lamp that reveals a hidden message. Pure CSS art.

## Overview

After making the koala css art I became curious about this use of CSS and made this lamp. :heart_eyes:

### The challenge

A 1 day challenge to create a set of traffic lights that light up.
  - Pure CSS (no SVG, Canvas or JS allowed)
  - Lights will be on a continuous cycle

## Tech stack

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- SASS

## What I learned

The amount of `div` elements required to create CSS art is crazy!.
You really need to plan out the drawing to decide if you need a whole new `div` or you need to 
use one or both _pseudo-elements_ `::before` and `::after`.
